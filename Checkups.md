# Bridge Logistics Checkups

## 1. Troubleshooting

In order to make sure that the Demo runs smoothly please check the following

1. In your `/etc/hosts` you have this:

```shell
127.0.0.1       bl_central_kafka_server
```
3. Start the services in the containerized environment

```shell
make docker
```

4. Make sure to check everything after you start `make docker`:

```shell
make logs-cassandra-server
make logs-bridge-kafka-server
make logs-train-kafka-server
```

5. Restart the apps container

```shell
make docker-apps
```

6. If you see any error logs on the previous commands, please try the following commands:

```shell
make docker-dependent
make docker-train
make docker-cassandra
make docker-bridge
```

Recheck if they all started well this time and restart the apps container.

7. Start [MeterReadingsLauncher](bl-central-server/bl-meters-readings-service/src/main/scala/org/jesperancinha/logistics/meters/readings/MetersReadingsLauncher.scala) and [PassengersReadingLauncher](bl-central-server/bl-passengers-readings-service/src/main/scala/org/jesperancinha/logistics/passengers.readings/PassengersReadingsLauncher.scala) outside the containers

8. Enjoy the game! ðŸš‚
