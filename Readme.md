# Bridge Management Logistics

Starting from the example of [Michel Schudel](https://github.com/MichelSchudel), this is an application to be build using a JMS messaging system to serve the logistics for a bridge management system.  
If you look at the first [brick](https://github.com/jesperancinha/bridge-logistics/blob/master/bridge-logistics-jms/src/main/java/com/jesperancinha/bridgelogistics/services/BridgeOpeningService.java) of this project, you can see that the whole project involves managing timetables as a kick-start.
The project will be expanded to further goals.  

Current goal is to use ActiveMQ as a JMS provider. 
JMS provider will play following roles:

1.   Count passengers going through a bridge
2.   Register transport type
3.   Register merchandise before crossing the bridge
4.   Register events per configured range area

Passengers are registered by numbers and if they they carry extra merchandise or a bike
Transport can be a train, bus, boat, bike, truck, etc.
Merchandise should registered if it's destined to commercial exchanges.
Events can be anything that may happen in a configured range around the bridge

For passengers, a development area will be created called PCS(Passenger Control Service).  
For merchandise, a development area will be created called MCS(Merchandise Control Service).  
For bridge ranges, a development area will be created called DCS(Domain Control Service).
