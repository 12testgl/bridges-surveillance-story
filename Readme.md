This application uses event sourcing to serve the logistics for a bridge management system.	This is what in general this project is responsible for

1.  Count passengers going through a bridge
2.  Register transport type
3.  Register merchandise before crossing the bridge
4.  Register events per configured range area
5.  Inform trains of the train Schedule changes

Passengers are registered by numbers and if they carry extra merchandise or a bike	Transport can be a train, bus, boat, bike, truck, etc.	Merchandise should be registered if it's destined to commercial exchanges.	Events can be anything that may happen in a configured range around the bridge

1.  For passengers, a development area will be created called PCS(Passenger Control Service).
2.  For merchandise, a development area will be created called MCS(Merchandise Control Service).
3.  For bridge timetables and ranges, a development area will be created called DCS(Domain Control Service).

This project is also the official support project of my article on medium:

## A detective case

I have created an investigation Game. It's not a difficult one to solve. Basic math will get you through to find the thief.

> A passenger unsuspectingly travelling in a train carrying a leather suitcase with an old 5Kg computer filled with classified information has had its bag stolen.
> The suspect jumps off the train while it passes through a connecting bridge
> In the far we see a person in a parachute falling down through the air into a boat which catches this person a moves away
> The passenger, a special agent keeps their cover and worries if this secret spy will ever be caught

You, the player are responsible for finding the secret spy! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç üîç

Steps:

1.  Go to PostgresSQL database on schema `bllogistics` in table `trains_log`. Filter by `check_in_out='CHECKIN' or check_in_out='CHECKOUT'`
	1. You will find two carriages with different weights at `CHECKIN` and at `CHECKOUT`.
	2. On carriage has a weight reduction of two people.
	3. This is because, while passing through the bridge, the `spy` takes the bag from the `special agent` and run to the next carriage.
	4. The `special agent` follows the `spy` and chases the `spy`.
	5. In another carriage, there is an increase in weight, but just for the special agent
	6. The secret spy has escaped through the toilet's window and with precision jumped off the bridge in a parachute.
	7. The formula is: SPY_WEIGHT = (CARRIAGE_1_CHECKIN_WEIGHT - CARRIAGE_1_CHECKOUT_WEIGHT) - (CARRIAGE_2_CHECKOUT_WEIGHT - CARRIAGE_2_CHECKIN_WEIGHT).
2.  Calculate the difference in weight
3.  Go to Cassandra database on keyspace `readings` in table `passengers`. Filter by the weight you find. These are the suspects
4.  If you only have one suspect. Then congratulations you have found the secret agent who stole the bag.
5.  Type your answer in the following format `firstName` + ` ` + `lastName`

Note that the story I‚Äôve created is purely fictional. Any similarity between events and the characters generated and the locations described is purely coincidental. It is practically impossible to make a random scenario that doesn‚Äôt have anything in common with anyone‚Äôs personal life. This is the reason why it is so important that the reader of this article understands that. This is also the reason why all the names in this exercise are automatically randomly generated, precisely to reduce the possibility of such similarities to occur.	You DO NEED to generate the names first. By running file [passenger_generator.py](./bl-simulation-data/passenger_generator.py), you will find 4 files in the [passengers](./bl-simulation-data/passengers) folder.	In this file, you will find automatically generated names.	If you want to make this more fun you can add your own chosen names.	Just remember that each line must be a single name.

4.  [bl-demo-server](./bl-demo-server): This server ensures that a simulated train passes through the bridge. It will use all different container ports to execute the simulation and create a different case everytime the simulation is run.

## How to quickly start

Make sure you have enough resources and that you are running [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop):

1.  At least 6Gb available memory
2.  At least 8 cores
3.  At least 5Gb to 10Gb of free diskspace

Please check the [Makefile](./Makefile) and make sure you understand the available options before calling them.

This whole demo is quite a heavy example to run. Because it can be difficult to run, given the amount of resources consumed, I have made a [Checkups](./Checkups.md) guide and an example [Guide](./Guide.md) file. Please read through them before running the demo.

## Walk through

In order to make it easy to understand this example, I've made a [Walkthrough](./WalkThrough.md) document. This is intended to help understand the basic goal of this example.

## Constraints

1.  Trains go over static bridges which are mostly open. They can be closed for exceptional reasons.
2.  When trains go over bridge, we need to know how long the whole train took to cross it.
3.  We also need to know the complete weight being passed across the bridge in regard to merchandise.
4.  We aso need to know the complete weight being passed across the bridge in regard to people.
5.  The exact number of people will be an approximation and will be a result from a triangulation of passing through heat sensors and light sensors.
6.  Timetables and merchandise exchanges will be done via RabbitMQ.
7.  Sensor information will be sent via Kafka.
8.  People data will be sent via Kafka Streams.
9.  All Kafka streamed information will be handled via Apache Spark.
10. Bridge opening times are subject to conflict detection. Upon detecting one conflict between opening times. The bridge remains closed until the conflict becomes resolved.
11. Conflict registration changes state but never gets removed

## Installation Notes

To run this demo, you only need to have a docker engine installed or something that comes with it like Docker Desktop.	Further you need JDK 11 and JDK 16. This demo has been tested using [SDK-MAN](https://sdkman.io/) Java SDK version 16.0.1.hs-adpt:

```shell
sdk install 11.0.11.hs-adpt
sdk use 11.0.11.hs-adpt
```

```shell
sdk install java 16.0.1.hs-adpt
sdk use java 16.0.1.hs-adpt
```

Use Java 16 as the default. You'll only need Java 11 for the Kafka Readers.	If you want to install everything locally without the help of containers then please check help file [InstallationNotes.md](./docs/InstallationNotes.md).	Further Documentation is available at the [wiki](https://gitlab.com/jesperancinha/bridge-logistics/-/wikis/Installation-notes).

Install python libraries:

```shell
pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
```

Install virtualenv:

```shell
virtualenv venv --python=python2.7
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests
pip install pika
pip install enum
pip install kafka
pip install coapthon
pip install mqtt
pip install paho-mqtt
exit
```

## Review Logs

## Author notes

I hope you enjoyed the article and that you were able to start this demo.	I try my best to make these demos run as smoothly as possible. This is why I actually invite you to open an issue on this repo, should you run into difficulties running this demo, playing the game or even if you just have some suggestions for improvement.	Note that while a version is ongoing as of now with 2.0.0., there are constant changes until an official tagged release.
